            <p> ‚ÄúGrandfather, there are two wolves fighting inside of me. One is full of rage, is jealous and fearful. The other is full of peace, of joy and love. Which one is going to win?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhichever one you feed,‚Äù replied the old man. </p>

           <p> Artists and other creatives are a special species. With a deep desire to express inner landscapes in compositions that bring the rest of us to dream, many creators would prefer to spend their time locked away in the studio. But since the shift from music production to touring as a musician‚Äôs main income source, for many the studio-centric way of life seems like a distant memory. Today‚Äôs artists are required to do it all‚Äîfrom creating a steady stream of social media content, to managing a progressing release schedule, to non-stop touring‚Äîall to stay relevant in our fast-moving times.</p>

            <p>In this buzz of productivity, what happens to the creative mind and body? These days, each of us must find our own ways to deal with pressure, deadlines, and the ever-growing demand to deliver materials to support what is supposed to be a creative process. As a coach for mental & physical wellbeing, I work with leading figures in the creative industries to help them change negative mindsets and destructive behaviors. During the coaching they learn to make better lifestyle choices and gain more control over their health and state of mind. As a result they are able to reconnect to their creativity and feel inspired and excited by their life again. This guide will cover some of the most basic principles artists can use to feel their healthiest, while trying to do it all.</p>

            <h2> Get regular exercise </h2>

        <p>For tens of thousands of years, humans‚Äô sympathetic ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù stress response was crucial to our survival, quickly fueling our muscles with energy so that we could run away from danger. Today our stress levels (and feelings of danger) are consistently higher than ever, and yet these feelings are barely ever followed up by a physical response. As a result, all that ready-to-use energy gets stuck inside our muscles and tissues, leading to inner tension and, eventually, disease.</p>

        <p>This means: work out, move your body, stretch yourself! A flexible body creates a flexible mind. The yogis practice asana (a sequence of yoga poses) so that afterwards, they can sit in meditation with an undisturbed mind. Similarly, it makes sense to work out before sitting down for a long studio session.</p>

        <h2> Practice mindfulness </h2>

       <p> The first step to change something, is to notice it. Learn to check in with yourself regularly, even if that means setting reminders on your phone. Ask yourself multiple times each day: ‚ÄúHow am I? What do I need to do to have a better experience?‚Äù Then do that! It will also help you identify the most effective ways to change your state of mind. Get to know yourself, without judgement. </p>

        <p>As you check in with yourself, treat yourself as you would treat a good friend‚Äîbe kind, compassionate, forgiving, and patient. It sounds simple, but once we pay attention to our thought patterns, it‚Äôs shocking how frequently we allow negative, destructive thoughts to sneak in.</p>

        <h2>Breathe in, breathe out </h2>

        <p>Besides checking in with your mind and general wellbeing, learn to check in on your breath. Keep reminding yourself: ‚ÄúHow is my breath?‚Äù Deep belly breathing through the nose has a grounding and calming effect, while erratic, shallow breathing patterns will lead to erratic thinking.</p>

        <p>When inhaling through the mouth, the air will typically only reach the upper parts of the lungs (chest breathing), stimulating the ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù nervous system. By inhaling through the nose, the air comes in cleaner and warmer, allowing it to also reach the lower parts of our lungs (belly breathing), stimulating the ‚Äúrest & digest‚Äù nervous system. At the same time, the exhalation generally has a calming effect.</p>

        <p>This means: try to inhale deeply through the nose, and practice longer exhales than inhales. This will automatically calm your mind and bring about a more relaxed and focused state. This also works great before speaking or performing in public. </p>

        <h2>Here‚Äôs a breathing exercise to try before your next big talk or performance:</h2>

        <p>For five minutes, take an inhale on two counts through the nose and exhale on four counts.
        Try to feel into your body: the soles of your feet, the shirt on the skin, your belly moving with every breath.
        For anyone who wants to go further, try five minutes of alternate nostril breathing to balance the two brain hemispheres and release fresh energy into your system.

        <h2>Stay well-hydrated</h2>

        <p>Staying hydrated will help with concentration, digestion, and to keep your mind in a good place. Always carry water with you. If you find regular water boring, try squeezing in some lemon, or add sliced apple, cucumber, orange, and/or mint. Adding fruit or herbs doesn‚Äôt just look pretty and taste great‚Äîit also helps the water to hydrate you more efficiently by changing its structure to a more accessible version, than if you were drinking water alone.</p>

        <h2>Avoid alcohol & substances</h2>

        <p>Be mindful with alcohol and other substances. What can feel like a little helper to get you ‚Äúin the right mood‚Äù can cost you in the long run by undermining your physical and mental health. Learn ways to increase your energy levels and get in a relaxed and focused state of mind without having to rely on alcohol or mind-altering substances.</p>

        <p>This means: try to remove alcohol and other substances from your daily routine and make this choice known to your immediate environment. Instead, drink lots of water or other hydrating beverages such as coconut water, or try mate tea or green tea to keep your energy levels up. If you‚Äôre in a social drinking situation, you can sip on a longdrink glass of sparkling water with some ice and lemon, to avoid questioning.</p>

        <h2>Don‚Äôt compare yourself </h2>

        <p>Although most of us know that social media can exacerbate our feelings of isolation and lack, many artists think that their success depends on their presence on social platforms. They feel an expectation to feed the growing hunger for new content, while simultaneously having to stay informed with the activities of their peers. This behavior not only takes up an overwhelming amount of time and attention, but can also give the sense that everyone else is doing better than you are.</p>

        <p>However, authenticity and individuality is what makes an artist interesting. Paying too much attention to what others want or do, will undermine the self-confidence needed to create something unique. And while the act of comparing ourselves feeds the desire for recognition and peer validation, it strips away our innate desire to experiment and learn, which are the building blocks of a creative process.</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ Try these practices if social media tends to get the better of you:</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ Set a certain (limited!) time window aside for your daily social media bender </p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ Have a plan for how you want to spend time while you‚Äôre logged in (create a post, check an event page, respond to comments, etc.)</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ Unfollow any profiles that give you the slightest feeling of anger, frustration, or envy </p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ Remove your phone from the bedroom, or use Airplane Mode at night
        Do not check social media first thing in the morning or before you go to sleep </p>
