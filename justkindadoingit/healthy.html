            <p> ‚ÄúGrandfather, there are two wolves fighting inside of me. One is full of rage, is jealous and fearful. The other is full of peace, of joy and love. Which one is going to win?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhichever one you feed,‚Äù replied the old man. </p>

           <p> Artists and other creatives are a special species. With a deep desire to express inner landscapes in compositions that bring the rest of us to dream, many creators would prefer to spend their time locked away in the studio. But since the shift from music production to touring as a musician‚Äôs main income source, for many the studio-centric way of life seems like a distant memory. Today‚Äôs artists are required to do it all‚Äîfrom creating a steady stream of social media content, to managing a progressing release schedule, to non-stop touring‚Äîall to stay relevant in our fast-moving times.</p>

            <p>In this buzz of productivity, what happens to the creative mind and body? These days, each of us must find our own ways to deal with pressure, deadlines, and the ever-growing demand to deliver materials to support what is supposed to be a creative process. As a coach for mental & physical wellbeing, I work with leading figures in the creative industries to help them change negative mindsets and destructive behaviors. During the coaching they learn to make better lifestyle choices and gain more control over their health and state of mind. As a result they are able to reconnect to their creativity and feel inspired and excited by their life again. This guide will cover some of the most basic principles artists can use to feel their healthiest, while trying to do it all.</p>
