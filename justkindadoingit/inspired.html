            <h1> Staying Inspired </h1>

            <p> We as humans are creative as our brains create by interpreting multiple inputs and meshing them together into a mutated, reborn output. Without sufficient input there is not output and we struggle to produce creative content, let alone something we feel satisfied with. Here are some ways you should constantly be feeding your brain.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="list">
            <p> 1. Have the latest exhibitions and galleries in your feed. Broadsheet and Concrete Playground <br>always have something to do. The NGV always has something new to show for aswell. </p>

            <p> 2. Meet with other creatives. The Design Kids is a great organisation that has groups dedicated to cities around the world so your among locals and often organise social events. As simple as it sounds, make friends at uni, talk to others and collaborate. </p>

            <p> 3. Build a good feed of creative work that you can refer to. Browse instagram for designers and creative thinkers that excite you.  <a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/" >Behance</a> also offer a great platform to collate and organise work that you like.
