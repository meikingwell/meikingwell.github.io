            <h1> Prelude</h1>

            <p> Less than a month into 2017, I was thrust into a journey of self-reinvention when my marriage to my husband and business partner ended. Setting out on my new path, nicknamed ‚ÄúOperation Butterfly‚Äù by a friend, I felt like a chrysalis breaking free of its cocoon, suddenly in the process of a complete transformation. Back then, I imagined the change that followed would feel like Rebecca Solnit describes in her book, A Field Guide to Getting Lost, when she says, ‚ÄúThe process of transformation consists mostly of decay and then of this crisis when emergence from what came before must be total and abrupt.‚Äù However, it was only the beginning of a gradual evolution. </p>

           <p> While the inciting incident for my transformation‚Äîa divorce‚Äîwas sudden, the process of reinvention was more akin to Solnit‚Äôs description from another book, The Faraway Nearby, in which she notes, ‚ÄúEven earthquakes are the consequence of tensions built up over long spans of time, imperceptibly, incrementally. You don‚Äôt notice the buildup, just the release‚Ä¶ In movies and novels, people change suddenly and permanently, which is convenient and dramatic but not much like life, where you gain distance on something, relapse, resolve, try again, and move along in stops, starts, and stutters. Change is mostly slow.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Rebecca was right on both occasions. For me, change was abrupt at first and then slow and tenuous. Encompassing both the personal and professional arenas of my life, it was an opportunity to reinvent myself entirely by leaving The Great Discontent, the magazine I co-founded with my ex-husband, and eventually merging my social-worker roots with the years I spent interviewing hundreds of creatives by training to become a creative coach.</p>

            <p>My story is only one of many who have or will reinvent themselves at least once, if not multiple times, over the course of their lives. You might be there now. If so, this guide is for you. In it, I‚Äôll address how we know when it‚Äôs time for a change, steps to assessing what to change, moving forward with actionable goals, and building a foundation that will be sustainable for the long-term. Ultimately, self-reinvention isn‚Äôt about becoming someone else‚Äîit‚Äôs about realigning your life with what you want. It‚Äôs about becoming who you know you can be.</p>

           <h1> Reinvention by any other name </h1>

            <p> Change. Transform. Make different. Modify. Adjust. Shift. Evolve. What does the word reinvent actually mean? Before we dive into the details of the process, it‚Äôs important to define the word and establish our expectations. The Cambridge English Dictionary defines reinvention as follows: </p>

           <p> Reinvent:</p>

            <p>1. To produce something new that is based on something that already exists.</p>

            <p>2. To change your job and/or the way you look and behave so that you seem very different.</p>

           <p> There are two items of note in the definitions above. First, reinvention entails producing something new based on what already exists. It is not a total repudiation of what came before. In a recent phone conversation with my mentor I was reminded that even as I embark on new professional endeavors that will redefine my creative role, I am still me. You are still you wherever you go. Reinvention honors your past and all of the lessons, experiences, training, and expertise you bring with you while simultaneously looking forward to future possibilities. </p>

           <p>Second, reinvention goes beyond changing your job or the way you look. There is a difference between seeming different and becoming different. Making changes that focus merely on surface-level aspects of your life (i.e. ‚Äúif I change my job, I won‚Äôt be burned out anymore‚Äù) often won‚Äôt result in meaningful long-term reinvention. Instead, the newness can energize us for a while, but since we‚Äôll be working with the same internal parts and overall approach, eventually we‚Äôll find ourselves feeling the need to make yet another change. True self-reinvention happens from the inside out as you realign your life with your values, dreams, and priorities.</p>
