            <h1> Prelude</h1>

            <p> Less than a month into 2017, I was thrust into a journey of self-reinvention when my marriage to my husband and business partner ended. Setting out on my new path, nicknamed “Operation Butterfly” by a friend, I felt like a chrysalis breaking free of its cocoon, suddenly in the process of a complete transformation. Back then, I imagined the change that followed would feel like Rebecca Solnit describes in her book, A Field Guide to Getting Lost, when she says, “The process of transformation consists mostly of decay and then of this crisis when emergence from what came before must be total and abrupt.” However, it was only the beginning of a gradual evolution. </p>

           <p> While the inciting incident for my transformation—a divorce—was sudden, the process of reinvention was more akin to Solnit’s description from another book, The Faraway Nearby, in which she notes, “Even earthquakes are the consequence of tensions built up over long spans of time, imperceptibly, incrementally. You don’t notice the buildup, just the release… In movies and novels, people change suddenly and permanently, which is convenient and dramatic but not much like life, where you gain distance on something, relapse, resolve, try again, and move along in stops, starts, and stutters. Change is mostly slow.”</p>

            <p>Rebecca was right on both occasions. For me, change was abrupt at first and then slow and tenuous. Encompassing both the personal and professional arenas of my life, it was an opportunity to reinvent myself entirely by leaving The Great Discontent, the magazine I co-founded with my ex-husband, and eventually merging my social-worker roots with the years I spent interviewing hundreds of creatives by training to become a creative coach.</p>

            <p>My story is only one of many who have or will reinvent themselves at least once, if not multiple times, over the course of their lives. You might be there now. If so, this guide is for you. In it, I’ll address how we know when it’s time for a change, steps to assessing what to change, moving forward with actionable goals, and building a foundation that will be sustainable for the long-term. Ultimately, self-reinvention isn’t about becoming someone else—it’s about realigning your life with what you want. It’s about becoming who you know you can be.</p>

           <h1> Reinvention by any other name </h1>

            <p> Change. Transform. Make different. Modify. Adjust. Shift. Evolve. What does the word reinvent actually mean? Before we dive into the details of the process, it’s important to define the word and establish our expectations. The Cambridge English Dictionary defines reinvention as follows: </p>

           <h2> Reinvent:</h2>

            <p>1. To produce something new that is based on something that already exists.</p>

            <p>2. To change your job and/or the way you look and behave so that you seem very different.</p>

           <p> There are two items of note in the definitions above. First, reinvention entails producing something new based on what already exists. It is not a total repudiation of what came before. In a recent phone conversation with my mentor I was reminded that even as I embark on new professional endeavors that will redefine my creative role, I am still me. You are still you wherever you go. Reinvention honors your past and all of the lessons, experiences, training, and expertise you bring with you while simultaneously looking forward to future possibilities. </p>

           <p>Second, reinvention goes beyond changing your job or the way you look. There is a difference between seeming different and becoming different. Making changes that focus merely on surface-level aspects of your life (i.e. “if I change my job, I won’t be burned out anymore”) often won’t result in meaningful long-term reinvention. Instead, the newness can energize us for a while, but since we’ll be working with the same internal parts and overall approach, eventually we’ll find ourselves feeling the need to make yet another change. True self-reinvention happens from the inside out as you realign your life with your values, dreams, and priorities.</p>

            <h1> Recognizing when it’s time to reinvent</h1>

            <div class="hbuimage">

              </div>

            <p> “Something needs to change, but I’m not sure what.” “I don’t feel like I’m growing anymore.” “This isn’t the life I imagined for myself.” “I just feel stuck.” </p>

           <p> Sound familiar? It’s common to experience feelings of boredom, feel stuck, wonder if we’ve stopped growing, and question our path every now and then as life ebbs and flows. Sometimes those feelings are a normal part of the process and pass quickly, but other times they indicate that we are in need of a bigger change. When uncomfortable feelings and questions of doubt continue to bubble up to the surface, or intensify, it can be a sign that it’s time to re-evaluate our lives and the direction we’re headed in.</p>

            <p>Here are a few signs it might be time to consider reinventing yourself:</p>

            <p>1. Your growth has plateaued. Growth happens in seasons and is more intense during certain phases of our lives, like our college years or when we start a new job or undergo a big life-changing experience. However, if you’ve stopped growing as a person and a professional and feel bored, unchallenged, and disinterested, you might need a change. We’ll talk about identifying what to change in the next section, so keep reading.</p>

           <p> 2. Your life is no longer aligned with your values and goals. At some point you stopped living the life you wanted and began to live the life you thought you were supposed to live. You became the perfect employee, partner, parent, child, friend, etc. But this has left you feeling disconnected with your life in the day to day. If your life is out of alignment with what you value and what you want to accomplish, it’s time to choose a new course—one that is fully yours. </p>

           <p>3. Your current life isn’t sustainable and is leading to exhaustion and burnout. Living a life that leads to exhaustion and burnout will require reinvention at some point—either you choose to proactively reinvent yourself, or you will be forced to do so when you officially burn out and every area of your life is affected, from career to physical health to relationships. If you’re on this path, it’s time to reinvent as prevention.</p>

           <p>4. Life circumstances provide an opportunity for change. Sometimes we choose to hit pause and re-evaluate our lives, and other times we are asked to stop and recalibrate due a change in circumstances. That’s what happened when I got divorced, however, instead of trying to recreate my old life, which was impossible, I took it as an opportunity to reinvent myself. If life is giving you an opportunity to build off of the momentum of change to reinvent yourself, accept it.</p>

           <p>5. You are running toward rather than away from something. The purpose of reinvention is not to run away from something—your job, family, partner, city, or life. Reinvention is an opportunity to run toward something that has been calling you. If you have a clear idea of what you want to do next, or are feeling drawn to a particular curiosity or direction, it might be time to go for it.</p>

           <p>6. Your intuition tells you so. Sometimes we just know it’s time for a change. Of course it’s not wise to uproot our entire lives based on a fleeting feeling, but don’t underestimate the power of your gut or intuition to hint that it’s time to reinvent. If you have a nagging gut feeling, there’s probably something there worthy of further exploration.</p>

           <p>7. You’ve given it time and still feel the same way. If you’re unsure, give yourself time. Set a date on the calendar that allows you a reasonable period of time to mull it over, weigh the pros and cons, and carefully consider how reinvention could affect all the parts of your life. If time passes and you still have the desire to reinvent, combined with any of the indicators above, it’s likely that you’re ready.</p>

           <p>This list isn’t exhaustive or final. There may be other indications that it’s time to reinvent. Thus it’s important to spend time with yourself, reflect on a regular basis, lean into your own understanding, and practice trusting your intuition as your voice becomes more clear.</p>
