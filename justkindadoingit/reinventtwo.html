            <h1> Recognizing when it’s time to reinvent</h1>

            <p> “Something needs to change, but I’m not sure what.” “I don’t feel like I’m growing anymore.” “This isn’t the life I imagined for myself.” “I just feel stuck.” </p>

           <p> Sound familiar? It’s common to experience feelings of boredom, feel stuck, wonder if we’ve stopped growing, and question our path every now and then as life ebbs and flows. Sometimes those feelings are a normal part of the process and pass quickly, but other times they indicate that we are in need of a bigger change. When uncomfortable feelings and questions of doubt continue to bubble up to the surface, or intensify, it can be a sign that it’s time to re-evaluate our lives and the direction we’re headed in.</p>

            <p>Here are a few signs it might be time to consider reinventing yourself:</p>

            <p>1. Your growth has plateaued. Growth happens in seasons and is more intense during certain phases of our lives, like our college years or when we start a new job or undergo a big life-changing experience. However, if you’ve stopped growing as a person and a professional and feel bored, unchallenged, and disinterested, you might need a change. We’ll talk about identifying what to change in the next section, so keep reading.</p>

           <p> 2. Your life is no longer aligned with your values and goals. At some point you stopped living the life you wanted and began to live the life you thought you were supposed to live. You became the perfect employee, partner, parent, child, friend, etc. But this has left you feeling disconnected with your life in the day to day. If your life is out of alignment with what you value and what you want to accomplish, it’s time to choose a new course—one that is fully yours. </p>

           <p>3. Your current life isn’t sustainable and is leading to exhaustion and burnout. Living a life that leads to exhaustion and burnout will require reinvention at some point—either you choose to proactively reinvent yourself, or you will be forced to do so when you officially burn out and every area of your life is affected, from career to physical health to relationships. If you’re on this path, it’s time to reinvent as prevention.</p>

           <p>4. Life circumstances provide an opportunity for change. Sometimes we choose to hit pause and re-evaluate our lives, and other times we are asked to stop and recalibrate due a change in circumstances. That’s what happened when I got divorced, however, instead of trying to recreate my old life, which was impossible, I took it as an opportunity to reinvent myself. If life is giving you an opportunity to build off of the momentum of change to reinvent yourself, accept it.</p>

           <p>5. You are running toward rather than away from something. The purpose of reinvention is not to run away from something—your job, family, partner, city, or life. Reinvention is an opportunity to run toward something that has been calling you. If you have a clear idea of what you want to do next, or are feeling drawn to a particular curiosity or direction, it might be time to go for it.</p>

           <p>6. Your intuition tells you so. Sometimes we just know it’s time for a change. Of course it’s not wise to uproot our entire lives based on a fleeting feeling, but don’t underestimate the power of your gut or intuition to hint that it’s time to reinvent. If you have a nagging gut feeling, there’s probably something there worthy of further exploration.</p>

           <p>7. You’ve given it time and still feel the same way. If you’re unsure, give yourself time. Set a date on the calendar that allows you a reasonable period of time to mull it over, weigh the pros and cons, and carefully consider how reinvention could affect all the parts of your life. If time passes and you still have the desire to reinvent, combined with any of the indicators above, it’s likely that you’re ready.</p>

           <p>This list isn’t exhaustive or final. There may be other indications that it’s time to reinvent. Thus it’s important to spend time with yourself, reflect on a regular basis, lean into your own understanding, and practice trusting your intuition as your voice becomes more clear.</p>
