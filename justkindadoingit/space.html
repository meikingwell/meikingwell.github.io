            <p>Seventeen years ago, I emailed my network of friends and fellow artists asking for leads on a new-apartment hunt. Long after I‚Äôd settled into my new place, so many incredible referrals kept pouring in that I couldn‚Äôt keep them to myself. I started sharing my trove of apartment leads with my wider network, and Listings Project‚Äîa weekly roundup of opportunities serving artists and creative communities‚Äîwas born. </p>

           <p> As Listings Project has grown, my team and I continue to correspond with each lister directly. In the process, we have collected a wealth of insights on how people who derive their income and/or fulfillment from their creativity tend to live and work, how they aspire to live and work, and what makes a living arrangement or workspace fuel a creative practice.</p>

            <p>In this guide, I will draw on my own observations as well as the experiences of our community to offer some insights on the process of finding and reconfiguring our homes and workspaces to inspire (not zap, drain, or deplete) our artistic lives.</p>
