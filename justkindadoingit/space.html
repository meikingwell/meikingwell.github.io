            <p>Seventeen years ago, I emailed my network of friends and fellow artists asking for leads on a new-apartment hunt. Long after I‚Äôd settled into my new place, so many incredible referrals kept pouring in that I couldn‚Äôt keep them to myself. I started sharing my trove of apartment leads with my wider network, and Listings Project‚Äîa weekly roundup of opportunities serving artists and creative communities‚Äîwas born. </p>

           <p> As Listings Project has grown, my team and I continue to correspond with each lister directly. In the process, we have collected a wealth of insights on how people who derive their income and/or fulfillment from their creativity tend to live and work, how they aspire to live and work, and what makes a living arrangement or workspace fuel a creative practice.</p>

            <p>In this guide, I will draw on my own observations as well as the experiences of our community to offer some insights on the process of finding and reconfiguring our homes and workspaces to inspire (not zap, drain, or deplete) our artistic lives.</p>

            <p>‚Äî Stephanie Diamond</p>

            <h1> Step 1: Clarify your needs, and ask for what you want</h1>

            <h2> Some things to consider: </h2>

            <p>‚Ä¢ How far away from work do you want to be, and how do you plan to get there (bike, subway, car, etc.)?</p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ Where do your friends and/or family live, and how far from them do you want to be?</p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ What size space would you like? What size space do you actually need?</p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ How important is natural light, and how often will you be home during daylight hours to enjoy it?</p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ What room in your house or apartment do you tend to spend the most time in, and therefore want to prioritize in your future space?</p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ Do you tend to spend most of your waking hours outside of home, and if so, how might acknowledging that affect your priorities?</p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ Budget: How much can you afford to spend each month on your space?</p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ Are you looking to live alone, or with roommates? How will this affect your cost of living, and what are the pros and cons? </p>

            <h1>Step 2: Pinpoint your requirements, but leave room for serendipity</h1>

            <p>For many people working in creative fields, budget will always be an issue. We all know that you usually can‚Äôt get every single thing you want from real estate or a roommate, so after clarifying your wants and needs, be sure to re-read your list and take note of which things are actual requirements.</p>

            <p>Also, remember that stepping outside of your comfort zone has the potential to inspire new ideas and personal breakthroughs.</p>

            <p>Financial constraints are generally behind the decision to seek out roommates instead of living alone. But we frequently hear from listers whose roommates actually fuel and inspire their creativity. Often, this seems to happen when those roommates specialize in art forms that are different from the lister‚Äôs. </p>

            <h1> Step 3: Unpacking the roommate question </h1>

            <p>Some people, particularly those who spend their work days in solitude or draw their energy from being around others, prefer living with roommates to living alone. For others, living with roommates is a financially driven decision. Sometimes it‚Äôs a matter of making a tradeoff and thinking through whether you‚Äôd rather have your own small retreat in a less-than-ideal neighborhood, or a larger, lovelier shared space in the neighborhood you prefer.</p>

            <p>If you do decide to live with others, know that finding a great roommate is all about finding the right fit. One person‚Äôs hard-to-live-with roommate can be the yin to someone else‚Äôs yang. Compatibility and chemistry are key to finding a good match; then, once you‚Äôve found one, consideration and communication are essential to keeping the relationship on track. To thrive in a roommate situation, it‚Äôs important to embrace your roommates‚Äîat least emotionally. </p>

            <p>To find a roommate who‚Äôs compatible with you and your needs, I always recommend being as specific as possible (when writing or responding to a listing) about who you are, what you‚Äôre looking for in a roommate, how you live, and what you value in your home.</p>

            <h1>Step 4: See what spurs your creativity by tracking it</h1>

            <p>If you‚Äôre specifically looking for a new space to help fuel your creative practice, spend a week diligently keeping a journal of when inspiration strikes and/or when you do your best work. By doing this, you can then adjust your home (or your listing) accordingly to maximize those opportunities. Do you have creative thoughts when you‚Äôre in the shower? If so, consider spending a Sunday scrubbing your bathroom, finally fixing that leaky sink, getting a new shower curtain, or even adding a white board to the wall so you can more easily jot down ideas. With these small changes, you‚Äôll be enhancing the space where you do some of your best work.</p>

            <h1>Step 5: Make space to space out</h1>

            <p>Whether you‚Äôre currently living in a space you love, or you‚Äôre looking for your next place, it‚Äôs always important to cultivate one particular spot in your home where you can connect with your creative flow. Even if it‚Äôs as simple as one chair near a window that you designate as a space-out chair, or a simple candle surrounded by sacred objects, it‚Äôs important to have a space that you associate with clearing your mind and spacing out. This can be done in the smallest apartment. Even in my tiniest homes, I‚Äôve always made it a point to gather some of my favorite objects onto a single table or shelf. When I feel the need to clear my head, I sit down and focus on these objects, which function almost like an altar.</p>

            <h1>Step 6: Make your home a hub of creativity</h1>

            <p>Hosting dinner parties, art openings, or salons can be done on a small budget and can make your home feel like a hub for you and your creative friends. This is especially important in an age when so much of our social and interactive lives take place through phones and computers. When we choose to get together in person, we change the content and tenor of our conversations; and when we host such gatherings, we change the character of our homes.</p>

            <p>A few years ago, I used to periodically invite friends to my apartment for jewelry sales featuring my friend‚Äôs beautiful sterling silver and beaded creations. Days after the guests left, the apartment would buzz with energy from the gathering. One of my art projects, Social Practice Eats, was a monthly gathering of social practice artists and cultural producers for potluck dinners in people‚Äôs homes. Each dinner was organized around a theme and a set of discussion questions, and the intimate setting enabled a level of vulnerability and candor that wouldn‚Äôt have transpired in a different space.</p>

            <h1> Step 7: Considering when it might be time for a separate creative workspace</h1>

            <p>How do you know when you need a separate studio or workspace to be most productive and inspired, instead of doing your creative work at home?</p>

            <p>For some people, of course, paying the rent on a home as well as an office or studio is prohibitively expensive. But others find that they can increase their productivity (and often, their earnings) by making the investment in a separate workspace.</p>

            <p>As you consider whether or not it‚Äôs time for a dedicated creative work space, try tracking your productivity. When do you feel most focused and motivated? How and when are you able to translate inspiration into output? Be honest with yourself about how distracted you feel in your current space, and consider what would genuinely improve the situation. If all the distraction is actually coming from inside your computer, for example, opting for a dedicated workspace may not improve your productivity‚Äîwhereas the distracting roommate situation would indeed be improved by a second space.</p>
